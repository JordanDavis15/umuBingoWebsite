        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                A SOL wallet is an address that allows SOL or SOL tokens to be sent and received. These wallets often come in the form of 
                software that is easily installed on any mobile device. After installing a SOL wallet, input the given address into the login 
                screen to play today's game.

                After entering your SOL address and choosing a category of questions, a bingo card is presented to you. There is a question 
                displayed at the top of the screen which you should try to answer by choosing a square on the bingo card. If the answer is 
                not on the board, click or press (on mobile) the question and it will display a new question. If you choose the correct answer, 
                a X will display in that board space. If you choose the incorrect answer, nothing will happen to the board - guess again!

                You cannot close the tab and return to your game. If you start a game and then close your tab, you cannot play again
                that day. If you step away without closing your tab, your time does not pause. When you close the app on mobile, you
                cannot resume your game if you had not completed it.
