                software that is easily installed on any mobile device. After installing a SOL wallet, input the given address into the login 
                screen to play today's game.

                After entering your SOL address and choosing a category of questions, a bingo card is presented to you. There is a question

                not on the board, click or press (on mobile) the question and it will display a new question.
